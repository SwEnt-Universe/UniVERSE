# UniVERSE

## Pitch
Student life is full of 'what's happening tonight?' moments, but finding the answer is lost in messy group chats and generic city-wide apps. UniVERSE solves this by putting the entire social pulse of your campus onto a live, interactive map. Itâ€™s an exclusive community, verified by school emails, where you can instantly discover everything from study groups to pickup games, see where the crowds are with real-time heatmaps, and join event-specific chats to connect before you even go. It's not just an event app; it's your key to a safer, more connected campus.

## Features
1. Interactive real-time map to discover live events at a glance.
2. Built-in group chats to coordinate and connect with attendees before the event.
3. Simple event creation to organize your own meetups, parties, and study groups.
4. Advanced event filtering to find exactly what you're looking for by date or activity type.
5. Personalized user profiles to showcase interests and find like-minded people.
6. Student verification via school email to ensure a safe and exclusive community.

## Additional Features
1. Calendar integration to sync your social schedule directly with your personal calendar.
2. Generative AI suggestions for personalized event recommendations based on your interests.

## Requirements
- **Split App Model:** Part of the map can be stored locally, most of the data is stored on Firebase.
- **User Support:** Profiles, preferences, active chat for events.
- **Sensor Use:** GPS is used for map interactivity.
- **Offline Mode:** Profiles, recently viewed events, saved events are cached locally.
