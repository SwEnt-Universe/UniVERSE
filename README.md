# UniVERSE

## Pitch
Student life is full of 'what's happening tonight?' moments, but finding the answer is lost in messy group chats and generic city-wide apps. UniVERSE solves this by putting the entire social pulse of your campus onto a live, interactive map. It’s an exclusive community, verified by school emails, where you can instantly discover everything from study groups to pickup games, and join event-specific chats to connect before you even go. It's not just an event app; it's your key to a safer, more connected campus.

## Features
1. **Map-first experience:** The app is built around a live, interactive map. Events are discovered by where they are, so users can immediately judge whether something nearby is worth their time.
2. **Temporary event chats:** Each event has its own chat that appears when you join and disappears when the event ends, avoiding the clutter of dead group conversations.
3. **Profiles:** User profiles combine stated interests with a visible history of past events attended, making it easier to see whether someone’s actions actually match what they claim.
4. **Meaningful following:** Following someone is not just about seeing their content; it unlocks access to private, follower-only events.
5. **List view option:** For users who prefer efficiency over exploration, events can also be browsed in a compact list instead of on the map.
6. **Built-in trust signals:** Trust is based primarily on what users have actually done in the past, rather than on self-written descriptions.
7. **AI-assisted event wording:** An AI tool helps users turn rough ideas into clearly written events, adapted to the desired social or professional tone.
8. **Automatic event suggestions:** The system can generate event ideas by analyzing factors like time, location, weather, and season.

## Requirements
- **Split App Model:** Part of the map can be stored locally, most of the data is stored on Firebase.
- **User Support:** Profiles, preferences, active chat for events.
- **Sensor Use:** GPS is used for map interactivity.
- **Offline Mode:** Profiles, recently viewed events, joined events are cached locally.
